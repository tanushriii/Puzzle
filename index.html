        Puzzle guarantees your child's safety by protecting the school itself. Instead of arming faculty with guns, it
        has a tested lockdown system that can recognize the presence of a gun or trespasser on campus using its high tech security cameras. If these cameras aren't able to recognize the person, on each hallway next to classrooms there is also a metal detector that only detects a presence of heavy metal that no student would generally carry with them on campus. If it detects it, thick kevlar panels on top of all doors and windows in all rooms on campus will immediately shut down, a loud alarm will start blaring throughout campus, and an emergency message will be sent to police and ambulances.

           Instead of arming faculty with guns, Puzzle
        has a tested lockdown system that detects a shooter through its cameras or metal detectors. It has a high-end security system around a school's full campus that ensures that any trespasser gets caught. And, it also sends out alarms to ambulances and police to apprehend the person as soon as any of the cameras or metal detectors catches them. This lets the faculty, students, and parents get a sense of peace as soon as possible and also makes sure that no harm can be done.

            So that the threat can leave the school as soon as possible and the faculty and students can return to normal quickly, Puzzle immediately contacts all local police and fire deparments and hospitals to rush over to apprehend the trespasser as soon as its system detects them so that no damage or harm can be done.
